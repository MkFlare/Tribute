				<h3>
					MkLeo's Rise to the Top

				</h3>
				<h4>
					<p>
					As stated previously, Leonardo López Pérez, better known as MkLeo and sometimes Leo, is a Mexican professional Super Smash Bros. player who began his rise at the age of 8 years old. Soon after, Super Smash Bros. Wii U (also known as Sm4sh) was released and it wasn't very long before he would start appearing in several hig placings and top 8's of majors. Towards the end of the Sm4sh era, people where saying he had potential, and that he likely would be the best player, and soon enough, SSBU was releaed and the tale unfolded soon after. Mkleo picked up the newly released character Joker, and ended up getting 33rd at a major in Japan, making people believe the character wasn't so good. Right after that placement, he kept playing the character  and would go on to show the just how excellent he and the character really were, winning several of the Apex series tournaments, EVO 2019, and many more large tournaments. His last major win before the pandemic would be Frostbite 2020, where he woul make one of the most legendary losers runs of all time. 

					During quarintine, he wasn't active in the online tournament scene as the game didn't, and still doesn't, have the best netcode. He instead focused on streaming on Twitch and uploading content to YouTube, occasionally coming close or winning an online tournament when he felt like it. 

					After quarintine was over, majors started coming back, with his next offline debue being Summit 3 of last year in late August. Many new players had risen since the "wifi era" and were taking big names, one such player being Sparg0. By this point, Leo no longer played Joker, and would move on to use a "worse character" being Byleth, where he would once again go on to win several of the next tournaments. In 2022, he found himself in a character crisis, winning tournaments with lots of other characters, as well as getting unexpected placements being 3rd at Collision and 9th at the most recent Summit Invitational. He is still undeniably the best player in the world, admitted by most of the top players in the world.
